A kernel of wheat if it falls upon the earth to perish a harvest of new life will rise up from the ground, if I lay down my life to die for the lord, he'll give us great revival. to cover all the earth.


Before tour day we sang kernel of wheat and it made me think about my testimony a lot. It reminded me of how small and weak my life was, in m-land I had literally nothing to give to God, but I gave a broken life to God and he completely restored and fixed me. Through this God has used me powerfully, turning my life from useless to the world to living for God.


My confession before Christ is rhe confession of a lot of young people everywhere today, depression, anxiety, suicide, and all other sorts of mental disorders are on the rise. The heart if many YG's is my life is worthless and there is nothing we can do.

Those who love their life and live for the world will lose it, but those who hate their lives and lose it for the gospel will save it.

God is preparing our generation to live for the gospel, we will hate the world and love him. He brought me and many others through this so we may love him, and he will continue to prepare many in this generation for this task.

I received this heart during that worship, and it really convicted me, I remembered tearing up and realizing where all of these threads were going. I had what I thought were a bunch of unrelated ideas floating around before hand, but this revelation tied everything together into one idea.

that's it

dang bro this deep :') this is so me this FO. God deserves so much more.. I did not have anything to give and the only thing I was able to give was a broken heart and soul but even with just that God poured out so much grace and is turning my life around giving me a new beginning. 

made me realize how God cherish (dude j forgot the word but not cherish)

worship
although serving worship can be stressful logistic wise, it's like that
yk when turkey yfo and and agmc 24 and even yfo tunland
I received lots of feedback
chosing setlist, receiving feedback, sometimes it's discouraging
During one of the w sets in tunland there was an awkward transition into kernel of wheat. Dawn pulled me aside and said why did that happen and why wasn't I going up for response.she explained that we weren't awake. man I was so discourage and I didn't want to serve. there was the internal struggle of serving worship. but God revealednthat reality the feedback is for us to serve God with the best of our ability. I shouldn't be discouraged but yk I have to look to God. worship is realy a spiritual thing so we have to be awake.
